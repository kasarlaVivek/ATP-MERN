password trap:
Even when an empty string is given , no errors are occured and hash is applied on empty string to give a hashed string.
Even after applying all the validations they wont work unlike other fields of document due to hashing.
because the mongoose validators are called at the time of saving hashed password which is considered to be satisfing validators.
